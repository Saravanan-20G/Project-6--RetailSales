### 1.Data Collection
Objective
Gather historical sales data to build the forecasting model.

Process
Data Sources: Collected data including store type, department, temperature, CPI, unemployment rate, holiday status, and store size.
Data Quality: Ensured data is clean and properly formatted for analysis.
### 2. Data Preprocessing
Objective
Prepare the data for modeling.

Process
Handling Missing Values: Addressed any missing values.
Outliers: Identified and handled outliers.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Encoded variables like store type and holiday status.
Scaling Numerical Features: Scaled features such as temperature, CPI, and unemployment rate.
### 3. Feature Engineering
Objective
Create meaningful features for the model.

Process
New Features: Created new features if necessary (e.g., interaction terms).
Feature Relevance: Ensured features are relevant and contribute to model accuracy.
### 4. Model Development
Objective
Build a predictive model for sales forecasting.

Process
Data Split: Divided data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Trained multiple machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
Model Evaluation: Evaluated models using performance metrics like RMSE and MAE.
Model Selection: Selected the best-performing model for deployment.
### 5. Model Training
Objective
Train the final model on the entire training set.

Process
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuned model hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Model Validation: Validated the model to ensure robustness and accuracy.
### 6. Model Deployment
Objective
Deploy the model for real-time predictions.

Process
Model Saving: Saved the trained model using joblib.
Application Development: Developed a Streamlit application to provide an interactive user interface.
### 7. Streamlit Application Development
Objective
Create a user-friendly web app for sales predictions.

Process
Layout Design: Designed the layout and interface with input fields for store type, department, temperature, etc.
Model Integration: Integrated the model to provide real-time sales predictions based on user inputs.
### 8. Testing and Validation
Objective
Ensure the application works correctly and provides accurate predictions.

Process
Functional Testing: Tested the application with various inputs to validate functionality.
User Acceptance Testing: Performed user acceptance testing to gather feedback and make improvements.
### 9. Documentation
Objective
Provide comprehensive documentation for the project.

Process
README File: Wrote a detailed README file with project overview, setup instructions, and usage guide.
Documentation: Documented data sources, preprocessing steps, model development, and deployment process.
### 10. Deployment and Sharing
Objective
Deploy the application and share the project.

## Conclusion 
This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in solving real-world business problems. By following a structured approach and leveraging modern technologies, we successfully created a tool that meets the needs of retailers looking to forecast sales accurately.
